二叉搜索树（BST） 左子树 < 父 < 右子树

heigth blanced BST  : A *node* in a tree is height-balanced if the heights of its subtrees differ by no more than 1. (That is, if the subtrees have heights *h*1 and *h*2, then |*h*1 − *h*2| ≤ 1.) A *tree* is height-balanced if all of its nodes are height-balanced. (An empty tree is height-balanced by definition.)
